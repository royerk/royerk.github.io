## Me

### 2015 - 2017, data scientist for the France Homeland Security Department

*WIP*

### 2009 - 2015, studies
About myself: I did a master degree in aeronautical engineering (2009-2011) where I specialized in embedded systems. At the beginning of this degree I was quite fascinated by auto-pilots. Then I came to realize that, as complex as they can be, auto-pilots aren't very smart nor adaptive. Hopefully I had the opportunity to follow in parallel a master degree in computer science.

Then I did a PhD (2012-2015) on a mixture of data engineering and data science. I built a system of data integration & storage based on an ontology in order to collect data on electrical vehicles (*EV*) users (the PhD was in partnership with an electricity provider).

On top of this system I built a machine learning prototype to create users clusters and analyze their habits.
The goal was to potentially limit power consumption from *EV* being charged at a specific moment (typically massive power demand a few times a year).
So I created an offers' generator bringing in game theory elements that would take into account the cluster reaction towards past offers, their needs (*eg*: you can't expect people to comply to a "no-charge" night if they need their car at full capacity in the morning, even if they get a huge discount later in the day), etc.

I couldn't test this generator with actual users, so I developed a simulator!
With inputs resembling real users (actually I used real users plus random variations on those users).
First I tested my offer generator to check if it was detecting my inputs characteristics (clusters, habits...) correctly.
Then I applied an instruction: limit power consumption at a specific moment and validated that the offers were actually related to my virtual users.
By the end of my PhD I had a working work flow (from gathering raw data to high level analysis).

Unfortunately the *EV* market didn't boomed as expected. So the potential harm that *EV* charging could do to electricity peak consumption didn't justify further development.
